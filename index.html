<h2>Blog #1: Glacier National Park</h2>
<article>
    <title>Thoughts on Glacier National Park</title>
    <author>Helen Miller</author>
    <date>June 5, 2022</date>
    <p>Glacier National Park is home to hundreds of species of animals and thousands of species of plants. 
    The national park spans over three million acres and averages about three million visitors per year. 
    When I visited Glacier with a group of friends last summer, there were many restrictions on travel. We 
    have to book our campsite six months in advance, as well as purchase Going to the Sun Road bus passes 
    to ensure we could secure a ride up the mountain. Our first night was spent settling in, getting our
    tents assembled, and ensuring our campsite was bearproof.  </p>

    <p>Our second day in Montana begain our wilderness adventure. We drove up the mountain and hiked to Hidden
        Lake. It was meant to be an easy first hike, totaling around 6 miles. On day two, we woke up at three 
        in the morning to prepare for our most rigorous hike. We drove up the mountain and arrive by 5 in the 
        morning, still dark outside. We ate oatmeal and ensured our bags had enough water, then began our sixteen
        mile hike on the highline trail. We used headlamps until the sun rose, especially for the early portion 
        of the hike that took place on a steep cliff. The trail eventually led to an overlook of a glacier, making
        me wonder what the glacier looked like 20 years ago. 
    </p>
    <p>Given that none of us were avid hikers, we needed a day of rest after the Highline trail. We rented kayaks
        at the local livery and went out on the choppy water. We found a charming restaurant just outside of the 
        park that served what seemed to be the best breakfast in the world. Our final day of hiking was on the opposite
        side of the park. We got to see the lodge, a grizzly bear, and a moose on that trip. Overall we hiked 40 miles
        over the course of four days.

    <title>The Advantages of Having a Cat</title>
    <author>Helen Miller</author>
    <date>June 5, 2022</date>
    <p>Since the adoption of my cat Blue, I have determined there are several advantages to having a cat. 
    Cats are fairly low maintenance creatures. They require a person to be responsible for another life
    that is not their own, but without quite the same level of intensity as dog ownership. Cats are self sufficient,
    independent, and resourceful. They find ways to entertain themselves with common household items (e.g., 
    cardboard boxes, string, pens, insects, and ping pong balls). Perhaps the greatest advantage to owning a 
    cat is that it is litterbox trained, so there is no obligation to bring the cat outside several times to 
    use the bathroom. </p>

    <p>Every cat has its own personality so one is seldom bored. For example, Blue likes to "chase ghosts" 
    in the evening. She sprints up and down the stairs as fast as she can, meowing at the ceiling. There
    is always a certain intensity in her eyes when she goes through her evening jitters. Cats can give people
    a sense of companionship, without being over sociable. My cat acts as a source of humor, joy, and companionship.
    Additionally, my cat is a source of entertainment for any guests that I have. Immediately guests are more 
    comfortable when they have an animal to greet and observe.
